#Brightness Control With Hand Detection

///1. Abstract
This project leverages computer vision techniques to control screen brightness through hand detection and gesture recognition. By capturing hand movements in real-time using a webcam, the system allows users to adjust screen brightness with simple hand gestures, providing a convenient and innovative solution for brightness control. The primary objectives include detecting hand gestures accurately, mapping these gestures to brightness levels, and providing a seamless user experience.///
